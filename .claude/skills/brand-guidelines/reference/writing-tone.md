# Writing & Tone Guidelines

## Brand Voice

### Personality Pillars

**Professional yet Approachable**
- We're experts, but not elitist
- We speak with confidence, not arrogance
- We're formal when needed, friendly always

**Clear over Clever**
- Prioritize understanding over wordplay
- Use simple language, avoid jargon
- Be direct and specific

**Helpful not Pushy**
- Guide users, don't demand
- Suggest solutions, don't force them
- Support decisions, don't make them

**Confident and Reliable**
- Use definitive language
- Acknowledge when things go wrong
- Take responsibility, provide solutions

## Writing Principles

### 1. Use Active Voice
✓ **Good**: "Save your changes to update the record"
✗ **Bad**: "Changes can be saved to update the record"

### 2. Start with Verbs for Actions
✓ **Good**: "Download report", "Add new entry", "Export data"
✗ **Bad**: "Report download", "New entry", "Data export"

### 3. Be Specific and Concrete
✓ **Good**: "Enter your email address to receive updates"
✗ **Bad**: "Provide information to stay informed"

### 4. Address Users Directly
✓ **Good**: "Your transaction was successful"
✗ **Bad**: "The transaction was successful"

### 5. Keep It Concise
✓ **Good**: "Account created successfully"
✗ **Bad**: "Your account has been successfully created and is now ready for use"
